# DataStudio Connector

This is the code used for the [Four Keys Connector](https://datastudio.google.com/datasources/create?connectorId=AKfycbxCOPCqhVOJQlRpOPgJ47dPZNdDu44MXbjsgKw_2-s).  This is a read-only directory.  Any changes here will not take effect in the Connector, which is hosted on [Apps Script](https://script.google.com).

You do not have to use the Four Keys Connector to create a dashboard. If you're using the infrastructure from the setup, the data is in BigQuery and you can use any [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tutorials) integration to visualize your data.  The connector is provided to simplify the process.  For your information, all the queries for generating the tables are outlined in [METRICS.md](../METRICS.md).

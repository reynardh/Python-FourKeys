# Four Keys 2021 Roadmap

## Mission and Vision

Four Keys mission:

  Be the industry-standard reference implementation for the automated calculation of the [DORA](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/the-2019-accelerate-state-of-devops-elite-performance-productivity-and-scaling) Four Keys metrics.  

The vision for this is:

* All discussion of the DORA Four Key metrics center around the key data entities of Changes, Deployments, and Incidents
* A rich set of tool integrations and data mappings
* Clear guidelines on how to adapt the tooling to fit the organization's workflow

Non-goals:

* The DORA research includes predictive analytics, recommendations, and improvement strategies.  The Four Keys dashboard will not provide these resources. It will simply be a reflection of an organizationâ€™s software delivery performance.
*  Four Keys does not intend to be a one-stop shop for all operational performance metrics. The focus of this project should always be on the predictive metrics identified by the DORA research.
